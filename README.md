# Angular 2 Toasty with link
This is a custom version of the original ng2-toasty library (https://github.com/akserg/ng2-toasty)

This version just includes the ability of specifying a link for the toasty, allowing the user to easily navigate from the toasty.

Some of these APIs and Components are not final and are subject to change!
